# About Project

Blood Donation Supply Chain Traceability is a complex network of several independent entities that include donar, blood banks,  hospitals and patients. 

Tracking supplies through this network is non-trivial due to several factors including lack of information, centralized control and competing behaviour among stakeholders.
